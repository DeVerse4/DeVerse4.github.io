# Hostel-Management-System
This is an online hostel managing platform for a institution where the student and faculty register with their details. The institution can manage all the student and faculty details and all the hostel related stuffs by using this portal. For further description read the README file.
## Inspiration
In our hostel, it is very difficult to manage all the details of the students as it is not online managed. All the working of hostel is offline so some works like gate pass system, attendance management system , etc are difficult to manage. We took this as our problem statement tried to solve these issues.

## What it does
Right Now, this project contains a website which is a Hostel Management System. It is a website for a Hostel which takes and stores all the details of the student residents in hostel. 
It have several webpages like *sign-up, login, User Dashboard, Events and Gallery, About section, Contact details, Raise a complain, Notices for hostellers, Gate Pass Generation*.

## How we built it
We made this project using front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5,Javascript and for back-end, we used PHP and MySQL.

## Challenges we ran into
Due to the lack of guidance, it was very difficult to build the project from scratch. 
Taking the details of hostellers and storing it into the database was a tough task that we resolved and are now able to do that task.
Including the offline system into an online system was the main challenge.
We also used Django while building this website but by the guidance of someone we used PHP for back-end. So it was not easy to shift to different technology.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are successfully able to store and use every details of hostellers.
We are proud of our synergy while making the project was good. We ran through many problems but we solved it together.

## What we learned
Learned data management of users on back-end
               _ making responsive and user-friendly webpages_

## What's next for Hostel Management
We have to improve following features to our website:
           *Gate Pass Generation technology*
           *Events and Gallery*
We will include new features like *Daily attendance management system, **faculty data management* and much more.
